# broQue - a new enterprise message queue

This is a new enterprise message queue.
I know there's already a lot of them around.
I wrote this one for a few reasons:

1. Most message queues are a pain to install and get running.
2. Most message queues don't realize that all other queue types are just degenerate forms of a stored pub/sub queue.
3. I couldn't stop thinking about it.

This does not aim to be the fastest or handle the most messages.
Its first claim to fame will be that it is dead simple to install and very reliable for small to medium sizes workloads.
Whether or not it goes beyond that, we'll see.
